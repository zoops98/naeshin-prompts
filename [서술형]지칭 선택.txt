Carole Ames, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, points out that it isn’t “quantitative changes in behavior” (such as requiring students to spend more hours in front of books or worksheets) that help children to learn better. Rather, it’s “qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.” In turn, these attitudes and responses on the part of students emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, the ways they’ve organized their classrooms. If the goal is to figure out how best to cover a set curriculum — to fill students with facts — then it might seem appropriate to try to maximize time on task, such as by assigning homework. But that’s unlikely to have a positive effect on the critical variables that Ames identifies. Perhaps it makes sense to see education as being less about how much the teacher covers and more about what the students can be helped to discover. More time won’t do a thing to bring about //that shift//.
